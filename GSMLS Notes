NJTaxAssessment
________________________________________________________________________________
17) Add logger messages to necessary parts of the NJTaxAssessment code

5) Continue working on the long_lat function
    - Change the filename variable syntax so the files can be found
    - Create a db cleaning function to use inside lat_long
    - Change the sheet name during the db save to overwrite the first sheet

7)Foreclosure
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
    *** I want to store this as a SQL DB. This script will automatically check the site every week to update the status of the properties in the
    db. After X amount of time after the sale of the property, the SQL DB will delete that entry. And add new ones if they already dont exist
16) Alter the NJTaxAssessment class for the nj_databases to find the db for one county and one city as well
    - Create an arg entry for 'county' and 'city' in nj_databases

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Unassigned
3) Continue working on the property_tax_legend function

# download_link1 = driver_var.find_element(By.XPATH, "/html/body/form/b[2]/big/a")
# download_link1.click()  # Step 5: Download the zip file
# threadobj = threading.Thread(target=NJTaxAssessment.unzip_and_extract,
#                              args=[counties[key], cities[k], download_link.split('/')[2]])  # Step 6: Unzip and save file
# started_threads.append(threadobj)
